## Our high-level approach:
## 		1. Initiate the protocol by creating a TCP socket connection to the server
##		2. Send an initial message to the server
## 		3. Receive a message from the server
##		4. Validate received message
## 		5. Evaluate mathematical expression and send the solution back to server
##		6. Repeat steps 3-5 until you get BYE message
##		7. Print a secret flag

## Challenges we faced:
##		1. Coming up with different error cases our client needs to handle
##		2. Making sure our client handles different cases of errors/invalid messages/exceptions.

## How we tested our code:
##		We mocked messages that we send to the server and receive from the server, thus 
##		we could test how our program reacts to different cases.
