# forwarding table is a dictionary of <IP: Port> 
'''
Forwarding Table is a dictionary of <IP, Port>
FUNCTIONALITY:
1) add entries
2) delete entries
3) flush the tale of any bridges port changes state (designated, root...)
4) timeout forwarding table entries 5 sec after receiving the last msg
   from that address
5) print 'forwarding', 'broadcasting' or 'not forwarding' when the bridge made 
   a decision

'''
Bridge:
FUNCTIONALITY:
1) for a spanning tree
2) handle failures
3) intruduce new bridges
4) learn location of end host
5) deliver and host packets to the destination
6) handle mobility between end-hosts getween LANs
7) bridge broadcast BPDU on all ports and dont broadcast more freq 
   than once/500s 
8) constantly listen to new roots and should know about
   which ports are active and inactive upon receiving each BPDU
